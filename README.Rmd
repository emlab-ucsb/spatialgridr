# spatialgridr <a href="https://emlab-ucsb.github.io/spatialgridr/"><img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="139" alt="spatialgridr website" /></a>

`spatialgridr` provides functions for gridding spatial data; i.e. taking raw spatial data and getting that data into a grid.

This package is still under development. Feel free to submit an issue with bugs or suggestions.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `spatialgridr` from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("emlab-ucsb/spatialgridr")
```

`spatialgridr` has three functions:

* `get_area()`: retrieves the boundaries for a marine or terrestrial area, such as a country or Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)
* `get_grid()`: creates a spatial grid
* `get_data_in_grid()`: grids spatial data


## Example

This shows how to obtain a spatial grid and grid some data using that grid.

```{r eval=FALSE}
#load the package
library(spatialgridr)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
devtools::load_all()
```

We can obtain grids in raster (`terra::rast`) or vector (`sf`) format. First we need a polygon that we want to create a grid for. In this example we will use the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of Samoa. We also need to provide a suitable projection for the area we are interested in, https://projectionwizard.org is useful for this purpose. For spatial planning, equal area projections are normally best.

```{r get_samoa_eez}
#get Samoa's EEZ
samoa_eez <- get_area(name = "Samoa")

plot(samoa_eez["geometry"], axes = TRUE)
```


```{r grid_raster}
#equal area projection for Samoa obtained from https://projectionwizard.org
samoa_projection <- '+proj=laea +lon_0=-172.5 +lat_0=0 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs'

# Create a raster grid with 10km sized cells
planning_grid <- get_grid(area_polygon = samoa_eez, projection_crs = samoa_projection, resolution = 10000)

#plot the grid
terra::plot(planning_grid)
terra::lines(terra::as.polygons(planning_grid, dissolve = FALSE)) #add the outlines of each cell

```

To obtain a grid in `sf` format we can use arguments `option = "sf_square"` or `option = "sf_hex"` in `get_grid` to specify square or hexagonal cells. We will create and plot a hexagonal grid with 10 km wide cells.

```{r grid_sf}
planning_grid_sf <- get_grid(area_polygon = samoa_eez, projection_crs = samoa_projection, resolution = 10000, option = "sf_hex")

plot(planning_grid_sf)
```

Now we can grid some data. Data can be in raster (`terra::rast()`) or `sf` format. Here's an example using global data mapping ridges which is in `sf` format:

```{r grid_sf_data, warning=FALSE}
# ridges data for area of Pacific
ridges <- readRDS(system.file("extdata", "ridges.rds", package = "spatialgridr"))

#grid the data
ridges_gridded <- get_data_in_grid(spatial_grid = planning_grid, dat = ridges)

#plot
terra::plot(ridges_gridded)
terra::lines(samoa_eez |> sf::st_transform(crs = samoa_projection)) #add Samoa's EEZ
```

And another example using raster data, in this case global cold water coral distribution data which has been pre-cropped to the Pacific

```{r grid_raster_data}
#load cold water coral data
cold_coral <- terra::rast(system.file("extdata", "cold_coral.tif", package = "spatialgridr"))

#grid the data
coral_gridded <- get_data_in_grid(spatial_grid = planning_grid, dat = cold_coral)

#plot
terra::plot(coral_gridded)
terra::lines(samoa_eez |> sf::st_transform(crs = samoa_projection)) #add Samoa's EEZ
```

We can also use the sf grid we created to return data in sf format:

```{r grid_sf_to_sf, warning=FALSE}
#grid the data
ridges_gridded_sf <- get_data_in_grid(spatial_grid = planning_grid_sf, dat = ridges)

#plot
plot(ridges_gridded_sf)
```

We can also grid `sf` data that contains multiple data features, such as habitat types. To do this, we provide the name of the column that as the `feature_names` argument in `get_data_data_in_grid()`. This creates a multi-layer grid. For raster data this means multiple raster layers and for `sf` grids multi-column objects. Here's an example using `sf` data that classifies the worlds deep oceans (Abyssal plains) into 3 categories: 

```{r grid_multi_sf, warning=FALSE}
#load the data
abyssal_plains <- system.file("extdata", "abyssal_plains.rds", package = "spatialgridr") |>
  readRDS()

#grid the data
abyssal_plains_sf <- get_data_in_grid(spatial_grid = planning_grid_sf, dat = abyssal_plains, feature_names = "Class")

#plot
plot(abyssal_plains_sf)
```

`spatialgridr` also works with grids that cross the antimeridian (international date line). You can set `antimeridian = TRUE` in `get_data_in_grid` if you know you are using a grid that crosses the antimeridian, or if `antimeridian = NULL`, the function will automatically determine if the grid crosses the antimeridian. Here's an example using Kiribati's EEZ as the grid area.

```{r}
#load the Kiribati EEZ polygon
kir_eez <- get_area(name = "Kiribati", country_type = "sovereign")

#create a grid for the Kiribati EEZ - Equal area projection obtained from https://projectionwizard.org
kir_grid <- get_grid(area_polygon = kir_eez, projection_crs = '+proj=laea +lon_0=-159.609375 +lat_0=0 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs', resolution = 20000, option = "sf_square")

#get abyssal plains classification for Kiribati grid
kir_abyssal_plains <- get_data_in_grid(spatial_grid = kir_grid, dat = abyssal_plains, feature_names = "Class")

#plot
plot(kir_abyssal_plains, border = FALSE)
```
