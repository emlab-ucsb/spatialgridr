# Get boundaries for an area of interest

Marine and land boundaries can be obtained. For marine boundaries, the
`mrp_get` function from the `mregions2` package is used to retrieve the
boundary (e.g. an EEZ) from [Marine
Regions](https://marineregions.org/gazetteer.php). For land boundaries
and the "seas_oceans" type, the package
[`rnaturalearth`](https://github.com/ropensci/rnaturalearth/) is used.

## Usage

``` r
get_boundary(name = "Australia", type = "eez", country_type = "country")
```

## Arguments

- name:

  `character` name of the country or region. If `NULL` all boundaries of
  `type` are returned. If an incorrect `name` is input, the user is
  given a list of valid names to chose from. Ignored for
  `type = "high_seas"`

- type:

  `character` the boundary type. Can be one of:

  - `eez`: Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ; 200nm). These EEZs differ
    slightly from the the [UN Convention on the Law of the Sea
    (UNCLOS)](https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part5.htm)
    definition because the archipelagic waters and the internal waters
    of a country are included.

  - `12nm`: 12 nautical miles zone (Territorial Seas), defined in
    [UNCLOS](https://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part2.htm)

  - `24nm`: 24 nautical miles zone (Contiguous Zone), defined in
    [UNCLOS](https://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part2.htm)

  - `ocean`: Global Oceans and Seas as compiled by the Flanders Marine
    Data Centre. Names are: "Arctic Ocean", "Baltic Sea", "Indian
    Ocean", "Mediterranean Region", "North Atlantic Ocean", "North
    Pacific Ocean", "South Atlantic Ocean", "South China and Easter
    Archipelagic Seas", "South Pacific Ocean", and "Southern Ocean".

  - `high_seas`: as defined by the UN Law of the Sea: "all parts of the
    sea that are not included in the exclusive economic zone, in the
    territorial sea or in the internal waters of a State, or in the
    archipelagic waters of an archipelagic State". Note that `name` and
    `country_type` are not relevant for this query: only all High Seas
    areas can be downloaded.

  - `country`: country boundaries from Natural Earth

  - `seas_oceans`: Seas, oceans, bays, gulfs, inlets etc. as defined in
    the Natural Earth marine polygons

  More details on the marine boundaries can be found on the [Marine
  Regions website](https://marineregions.org/sources.php), and for land
  boundaries (plus "seas_oceans"), the [Natural Earth
  website](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/features/). Note that data
  from Natural Earth is downlaoded at the highest resolution (1:10m).

- country_type:

  `character` must be either `country` or `sovereign`; ignored for
  `type = "high_seas"`, `"ocean"` or `"seas_oceans"`. Some countries
  have many territories that it has jurisdiction over. For example,
  Australia, France and the U.K. have jurisdiction over many overseas
  islands. Using `sovereign` returns the main country and all the
  territories, whereas using `country` returns just the main country.

## Value

'sf' polygon or multipolygon object of the boundary requested

## Examples
